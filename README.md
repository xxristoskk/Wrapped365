# Wrappe365

This project provides Spotify users a dashboard that mimics Spotify's end-of-year Wrapped stats.

As of right now, Wrapped365 is currently in an exploratory phase. The notebook is being used to define functions that will help explore a user's readable data, create visualizations, and build datasets. It will also be used to build ML models that will create recommendation playlists based on track features rather than what other users are listening to.

The code in the notebook will be used to build a Django app that will be hosted on PythonAnywhere.
